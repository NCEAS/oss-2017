# Open Science for Synthesis 2017: Gulf Research Program

[Open Science for Synthesis: Gulf Research Program](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/OSS2017) is a hands-on data science course for both early 
career and established researchers to gain skills in data science, including scientific synthesis, reproducible science, and 
data management. These skills are critical for understanding the complex environmental, human, and energy systems in the Gulf of Mexico, 
especially following large disturbance events like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. This 3-week intensive training, convening in 
July 2017 at the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu) in Santa Barbara, CA, will 
revolve around scientific computing and scientific software for reproducible science. Funding for the program is through a grant from the 
[Gulf Research Program](http://www.nationalacademies.org/gulf/about/) of the National Academies of Science.
